This project aim to solve The Lunar Lander environment for a continious action space using a DDPG algorithm

Nothing exept for the necessary imports are needed to run the DDPG implementation script

To run the provided script, you need to have the following packages installed:

numpy (version 1.21.0)
torch (version 1.9.0)
gym (version 0.21.0)
matplotlib (version 3.4.2)
You can install these packages using the following pip commands:
pip install numpy==1.21.0
pip install torch==1.9.0
pip install gym==0.21.0
pip install matplotlib==3.4.2
!sudo apt-get install -y swig
!pip install box2d-py
!pip install gym[box2d]
# LunarLander-v2 Agent

This project implements a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent to solve the LunarLander-v2 environment from OpenAI Gym.

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy==1.21.0
pip install torch==1.9.0
pip install gym==0.21.0
pip install matplotlib==3.4.2

python trainedmodel.py

To run the dppg_implementation.py use python dppg_implemeentation.py   # keep in mind this will reset the weights of the current actor.pth file!

The finished model is in the actor.pth and is called into the trainedmodel.py file for demonstration
